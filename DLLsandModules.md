The scripts depend on a set of DLLs available at http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/binaries.html. Be sure to grab all the DLLs (PROJ, GEOS, libspatialite, libconv, and librasterlite just for kicks (you may want to use it later but its not necessary for this converter)).
The scripts also need the ogr module available in the GDAL pypy repository:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/
and the Windows Binaries for GDAL at
http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/win32/1.6/

The promised installer will include all of these DLLs ASAP.
